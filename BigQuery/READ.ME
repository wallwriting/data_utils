These are data utilities specifically intended to be used for BigQuery.

The subdirectories contain the following:

random_data_generator uses functions, procedures, and/or scripts to generate randomized dummy data intended to be used for POCs, demos, and performance tests

table_data_generator creates both dummy and real data based not on functions, but on tables. For example, the meta_series table creates a table with sequence numbers that go on for billions of records. This table can be used to create multiple values of dummy data at once in cases where a function to generate a series or an array would fail due to there being too many rows to create.
