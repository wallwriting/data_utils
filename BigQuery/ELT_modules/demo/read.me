NOTE: Currently, demos have projects and datasets hard coded. They will have to be changed to your project and dataset to work properly.

This has demos of how a combination of ELT modules can be used to create pipelines in BigQuery.

- not_all_source_table_data_has_arrived.txt  -  This demos a scenario where, out of 5 source tables, data has only landed in some of those tables. The expected result is that the final generated table should only include the records where data has landed in all 5 source tables.

- not_all_sources_arrived_larger_data_volume - This is a similar demo to not_all_source_table_data_has_arrived.txt, but it does it at a larger data volume by first generating a much larger customer table.
