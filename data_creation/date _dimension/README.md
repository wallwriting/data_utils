Date dimension<br>
<br>
This spreadsheet can be used to create a DATE dimension in a data warehouse. The formulas can be used to create new data going forwards and backwards.<br>
The first value needs a couple of the formulas replaced with hard-coded value because they require a previous value to exist.<br>
The spreadsheet includes tabs to generate the data in different ways (as a csv to import, INSERT INTO DATE VALUES syntax, and INSERT INTO DATE SELECT syntax).<br>
The columns before and after date should be modified to the date format specifications of the database you're loading into.<br>
